"""Rewrite version strings across tracked files for a release bump.

Usage:
    python scripts/bump-version.py 0.1.0 0.1.1

- Skips the files and directories that narrate past releases (see SKIP below).
- Refuses to run when any of the five version-carrying files has drifted off OLD.
- Walks tracked files ending in .md / .py / .js / .mdc / .json / .toml.
- Applies a small set of exact-match replacements: `vX.Y.Z`, `"X.Y.Z"`,
  `agent-style@X.Y.Z`, `// X.Y.Z`, and `EXPECTED_VERSION = "X.Y.Z"`.

# These files narrate past releases by version number, so a blanket rewrite
# would falsify the record. RELEASING.md recounts which release fix-forwarded a
# packaging bug and which registry artifact still carries it; those sentences
# have to keep naming the release it happened in. TODO.md joined them after a
# bump silently rewrote "wait for the next bench" and "a new task for the next
# cycle" into the version being released, which changed what those entries
# asked for.
#
# Skipping is not the same as holding nothing live. CHANGELOG.md is mixed: its
# past entries must stay pinned, while its top-of-file "Version distribution"
# banner names the release being cut and is what RELEASING.md consults to decide
# what may be published. That banner is prose, so no exact-match pattern here
# can maintain it, and the drift check below cannot see it either. MANUAL_CHECKS
# is printed on every run so the ones this script deliberately will not touch
# are named rather than merely omitted.
# (Do not put a literal version in this comment: the script rewrites its own
# source too.)
