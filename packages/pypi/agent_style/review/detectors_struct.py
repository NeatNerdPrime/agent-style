"""Structural detectors: line/paragraph-level heuristics.

Rules with deterministic structural detectors:
  RULE-A  bullet overuse (lists whose items read as prose shredded into bullets)
  RULE-C  consecutive same-starts (≥ 2 of 3 adjacent sentences share opening token)
  RULE-E  paragraph-closing summaries (last sentence restates the paragraph topic)

Rules in the structural bucket that still have no detector and report
"skipped" (as of v0.4.2):
  RULE-02  passive voice when agent matters
  RULE-07  positive form for affirmative claims
  RULE-09  parallel structure across coordinate items
  RULE-10  keep related words together (subject/verb proximity)

These skipped rules return ``status="skipped"`` with a note explaining why, so
the JSON output remains schema-complete for every rule in the matrix.

    privileging ordered over unordered, and a numbered causal chain is exactly
    the fragmented prose the rule targets. Shortness is not evidence on its own
    either -- a checklist of terse imperative steps is short *and* genuine.

    So the test is the directive's own: "bullets are sentence shards with
    connective tissue stripped". Two shapes betray a shredded sentence, graded
    by how much they prove on their own:

    1. **Strong.** An item opens with a coordinator, subordinator or relative
       pronoun (``Because``, ``Which``, ``And``, ``Rather``), or some but not
       all items lead with ``Per``. Either is self-sufficient evidence, so it
       fires regardless of item length; an explicit ``Because`` shard is no
       less a shard for sitting in a list with one long item.
    2. **Weak.** Two or more items repeat a subject-and-copula opening
       (``It is fast`` / ``It is accurate``). Only counts when every item is
       also short.

    Bare prepositions are not evidence, and neither is an arbitrary repeated
    first-two-words key. ``For Linux, use apt`` heads a genuine per-platform
    enumeration and ``Run the migration`` / ``Run the tests`` is the
    directive's own checklist case; both stay clean, as do short independent
    labels. The cost is recall on ambiguous triads such as ``It accelerates
    retrieval`` / ``It improves accuracy``, where the second token varies.
    Those need a semantic judge, not a sharper regex.
